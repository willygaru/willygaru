Hi guys I'm @willygaru I'm new to all this :) 
- 👀 I am interested in full stack web design (html5, css, javascript, MySql) and segmented advertising development
- 🌱 I am currently learning junior level javascript
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on small projects that help me improve and learn, if possible meet people from Argentina to get involved in a community
- 📫 Contact me via email at wilsuuun91@gmail.com or here
- In moments I will be uploading some of the projects that I have been creating so that you can give your best opinions for my improvement
